## Challenges
### Challenge 1
In the first challenge we implemented two main functionalities of the *Nower* application.

The first one is, as a commercial store, easily send or publish a new promo about a product or service, specifying its restrictions (time and people).

The second one is, as a user, being able to visualize and pick a promo related to a product or service, obtaining a code that can be redeemed in the corresponding store.

This first challenge was developed using hybrid mobile applications. In this case, we picked the [Ionic framework] so that both client and user applications can be deployed for *Android* and *iOS* platforms.
